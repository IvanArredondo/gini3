    # The following code requires a bit of an explanation.
    #
    # We need to dynamically generate right-click menus for the OpenFlow controller 
    # that contain a list of POX modules the user can launch. When a menu item is 
    # clicked, the appropriate POX module should be launched.
    #
    # Normally, we could accomplish this simply by creating a signal handler function called 
    # "loadModule" and binding the trigger signal of each menu item to that function. The 
    # function would be able to use the QObject sender function to identify the module 
    # required and launch it.
    # 
    # Unfortunately, for some reason, this doesn't work. We can't add a signal handler to the 
    # OpenFlow_Controller class, since it doesn't extend QObject and won't have access
    # to the sender() function. We can't have this class inherit from QObject, nor can we 
    # create a separate class that extends QObject, because we keep getting cryptic error
    # messages when we try to do this or access sender().
    #
    # Since we don't have access to sender(), we're stuck creating unique functions for each
    # menu item to call that in turn simply call "loadModule" with a package name. Since 
    # the menu items are dynamically generated, this approach requires metaprogramming, 
    # which is very ugly, but this seems to be the only way to do it. :(
